			<h3>The Task</h3>
			<p>Design an interactive and innovative mobile information system that addresses the issues surrounding sustainable development and is centered around user needs and desires.</p> 


			<h3>Background</h3>

			<h3>Identifying the Problem</h3>
			

			<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
			<p style="font-size: 30px; line-height: 36px"><b>How might we help prospective EV Buyers become more informed on technical and financial aspects of owning an EV in order to facilitate their transition from gas-powered to electric vehicles?</b> <br><br>

				<b>Moreover, how could we help current owners and prospective buyers connect with each other to create a community in order to help facilitate the global transition to EVs?</b>
				</p>

			<h3>User Research</h3>
			<ol type="I">
				<li>Personas</li>
				<p> Based on our online research and community observations, we created primary and secondary personas based around the <b>Prospective Buyer</b> and <b>Current Owner</b>. The final versions of these personas were developed further through observations from user interviews in order to pinpoint the the needs, wants, and behavioral traits of our target users.
				<div id ="center">  
					<div class="personas">
						<img src="../images/evolve/Personas-May.png" alt="Primary persona">
						<img src="../images/evolve/Personas-Jay.png" alt="Secondary persona">
					</div>
				</div>

				</p>
				<li>Storyboarding</li>
				<p>After identifying our stakeholders, we formulated storyboards that illustrated scenarios that our users might face by establishing the context, the problem, our solution, and the resolution. This process enabled us to map out different features and visually communicate how our app would be address the pain points detailed in our personas. Furthermore, showing these storyboards during our user interviews allowed us to gain helpful feedback as to how realistic and applicable these situations and solutions were to daily life. </p>
				<div id ="center"> 
					<div class="storyboard">
						<img src="../images/evolve/Financial_Plan.png" alt="The financial plan feature helps May learn more about the costs and savings associated with EVs">
						<div class="img-des">May is worried about the higher initial cost of EVs, so the financial plan feature helps May learn more about the costs and savings associated with EVs.</div>

						<img src="../images/evolve/Car_Match.png" alt="The Car Match feature helps the user find an EV based on their lifestyle and budget preferences and minimizes research time">
						<div class="img-des">Jay is unfamiliar and overwhelmed by the variety of EV options, so the the Car Match feature can help him find the perfect EV based on his lifestyle and budget preferences and minimizes research time.</div>

						<img src="../images/evolve/EV_Community.png" alt="Creating a community of EV owners and prospective buyers facilitates communication and the flow of information">
						<div class="img-des">May is curious to find more information about EVs, so the Community feature connects with other prospective buyers and current EV owners to help answer questions and make suggestions.</div>

						<img src="../images/evolve/Community_Challenges.png" alt="The Community Challenge feature encourages users to get involved through environment-based games and spread awareness about the sustainable transportation">

				<li>User Interview Insights</li>
				<p>After conducting and analyzing 7 user interviews (3 primary, 4 secondary), I discovered 3 key insights:</p>
				<p style="font-family: Playfair Display;">
					<ol type="1" font-size: 24px;>
						<li>Secondary users are more likely to be less informed about EVs and could benefit from guidance during the research process</li>
						<li>Environmental impact is not a significant factor in EV consideration</li>
						<li>Primary users are more likely to dismiss EVs because of high cost than secondary users</li>
					</ol>					
				</p>
				<p>These findings significantly changed the trajectory of the app, as we discovered that even though we were tackling an environmental issue, <i>approaching the user from an environmentalist standpoint was not the most effective way</i>. </p>
					
				<p>Instead, we leaned into the “economical over ecological” mindset of the Prospective Buyer in order to <b>maximize efficiency for secondary users</b> and <b>increase financial transparency for primary users</b>. </p>

			</ol>

			<h3>Prototyping</h3>

			<ol type="I">
				<li>Sketches and Wireframes</li>

				<li>LoFi Prototype</li>

				<li>User Testing</li>

			</ol>

			<h3>Final Product</h3>
			<h3>Next Steps</h3>

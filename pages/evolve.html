			<h3>The Task</h3>
			<p>Design an interactive and innovative mobile information system that addresses the issues surrounding sustainable development and is centered around user needs and desires.</p> 


			<h3>Background</h3> 
			 California governor Gavin Newsom has passed a proposal to ban new gas-powered cars by 2035 to fight against California emmissions. This bold decision is well-intentioned and holds prospects for similar environmental acts across the US, but convincing the people and industries of an entire state, let alone the entire country to initiate this dramatic transition from gas to electric is a difficult task.


			<h3>Identifying the Problem</h3>
			<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas morbi viverra etiam sit elementum ornare aliquet integer nec. A, scelerisque viverra pretium bibendum sapien convallis euismod viverra commodo. Feugiat malesuada scelerisque malesuada lacus. Donec pulvinar est tincidunt sed nibh ullamcorper massa non. Habitant gravida at sed consequat, lacus condimentum pellentesque mauris. Tellus posuere in ultrices felis velit senectus adipiscing. Eu viverra at ut condimentum lectus. Tellus molestie amet elementum leo ultrices amet tincidunt. Volutpat pellentesque donec dictum dictum quam ac.</p>
			<p class="bold"> With that it mind, we thought about...</p>
			

			
			<p class=findings id="problem-statement"><b>How might we help <span style="color: #EA7197">prospective EV Buyers  become more informed on technical and financial aspects of owning an EV </span>in order to facilitate their transition from gas-powered to electric vehicles?</b> <br>

				<!-- <b>Moreover, how could we help <span style="color: #EA7197">current owners and prospective buyers connect with each other </span>in order to help facilitate the global transition to EVs?</b>
				</p> -->

			<h3>User Research</h3>
			<ol type="I">
				<li class="subsection">Personas</li>
				<p> Based on our online research and community observations, we created primary and secondary personas to establish our stakeholders. The final versions of these personas were developed further through observations from user interviews in order to pinpoint the the needs, wants, and behavioral traits of our target users.
				<div id ="center" class="personas">  
						<img src="../images/evolve/Primary_Persona.png" alt="Primary persona">
				</div>
					<p>Based on our online research and community observations, May represents our primary user base: the <b>Middle Class Prospective Buyer, age 30-45</b>. Stastically, they are starting families and have a commutable job, and thus are on the market for a reliable family vehicle. However, they may be wary of the high price tag associated with EVs and be more comfortable with operating gas vehicles </p>
					<div id ="center" class="personas">
						<img src="../images/evolve/Secondary_Persona.png" alt="Secondary persona">
					</div>
					<p>Jay represents our secondary user base: the <b> Upper Class Prospective Buyer, age 20-35</b>. Their higher salary affords them more financial freedom to choose an EV and the new technology may be more appealing to a younger generation. However, they may not view them as a first choice due to inconvenient charging times in a fast-paced, travel-heavy lifestyle.</p> 
					<p>This demographic is also the most stastically likely to be <b>Current EV Owners</b>, another essential element of our secondary user base, with many being new buyers who might benefit from a community of individuals with similar vehicle experience.</p>

				</p>
				<li class="subsection">Storyboarding</li>
				<p>After identifying our stakeholders, we formulated storyboards that illustrated scenarios that our users might face by establishing the <b>context</b>, the <b>problem</b>, <b>our solution</b>, and the <b>resolution</b>.</p>
				<div id ="center"> 
					<div class="storyboard">
						<img src="../images/evolve/Financial_Plan.png" alt="The financial plan feature helps May learn more about the costs and savings associated with EVs">
						<div class="img-des">May is worried about the higher initial cost of EVs, so the financial plan feature helps May learn more about the costs and savings associated with EVs.</div>

						<img src="../images/evolve/Car_Match.png" alt="The Car Match feature helps the user find an EV based on their lifestyle and budget preferences and minimizes research time">
						<div class="img-des">Jay is unfamiliar and overwhelmed by the variety of EV options, so the the Car Match feature can help him find the perfect EV based on his lifestyle and budget preferences and minimizes research time.</div>

						<img src="../images/evolve/EV_Community.png" alt="Creating a community of EV owners and prospective buyers facilitates communication and the flow of information">
						<div class="img-des">May is curious to find more information about EVs, so the Community feature connects with other prospective buyers and current EV owners to help answer questions and make suggestions.</div>

						<img src="../images/evolve/Community_Challenges.png" alt="The Community Challenge feature encourages users to get involved through environment-based games and spread awareness about the sustainable transportation">
						<div class="img-des">The Community Challenge feature encourages users to get involved through environment-based games and spread awareness about the benefits of sustainable transportation.</div>
					</div>
			    </div>
				<p>Showing these storyboards during our user interviews allowed us to gain helpful feedback as to how realistic and applicable these situations and solutions were to daily life. </p>


				<li class="subsection">User Interview Insights</li>
				<p>After conducting 7 user interviews (3 primary, 4 secondary), I took responsibility for all <a href= "../images/evolve/Interview_Coding.pdf" target="_blank" style= "text-decoration: underline; color: #b20a50">interview analysis and coding</a>  and discovered 3 key insights:</p>
					<div class=findings>
					<p>
					<ol type="1" font-size: 24px; class="big-indent">
						<li class="insight" id="first">Secondary users are more likely to be less informed about EVs and could benefit from guidance during the research process</li>
						<li class="insight">Environmental impact is not a significant factor in EV consideration</li>
						<li class="insight">Primary users are more likely to dismiss EVs because of high cost than secondary users</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				</div>					
			
				<p>These findings significantly changed the trajectory of the app, as we discovered that even though we were tackling an environmental issue, <i class="bold" style="color: #b20a50"><b>approaching the user from an environmentalist standpoint was not the most effective way</b></i>.</p> 
					
				<p>Instead, we leaned into the <span class="bold" style="color: #b20a50">“economical over ecological”</span> mindset of the Prospective Buyer in order to <span class="bold" style="color: #b20a50">maximize efficiency for secondary users</span> and <span class="bold" style="color: #b20a50">increase financial transparency for primary users</span>. </p> Furthermore, we saw an expanded role and possibility of interaction for current EV owners, as those that we interviewed expressed the learning curve of operating an EV and that they often found themselves helping others at charging stations.

			</ol>

			<p><b>So, our solution evolved into...</b></p>
			<p id="solution"><span style="color:#EA7197">EVolve</span>, the one-stop-shop for sustainable transportation preparation</p>
			<p>Our goal is to help the user create a curated financial plan, get matched with a car based on their lifestyle, and connect with a community of other prospective and current EV owners so that they can be more prepared and open to transitioning to an EV. </p>

			<h3>Prototyping</h3>

			<ol type="I">
				<li class="subsection">Wireframes</li>
				<p>With a clear goal in mind, we started by creating wireframes to map out possible features and interactions.</p>
				<a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/vvnRwJLFD5B2eAAiiEoxKt/A4--Wireframes?node-id=2%3A1349&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A1349&show-proto-sidebar=1" target="_blank"><span style="color: #b20a50; text-decoration: underline">View our interactive wireframes on Figma</span></a>

				<li class="subsection">User Testing</li>
				<p>We solicited other students and returned to our interviewees from the User Research stage to conduct short-task interviews in order to test our prototype. Many testers were able to complete the tasks with ease and remarked on the straightforward layout and interactions, but we stumbled on a few common errors caused by:
					
						<p id="error-title">Unclear Icons/Signifiers</p>
						<p></p>
						
						<p id="error-title">Low Readability</p></li>
						<p class="error-title">Lack of Clear Hierarchy/Grouping</p>

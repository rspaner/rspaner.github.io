			<h3>The Task</h3>
			<p>Design an interactive and innovative mobile information system that addresses the issues surrounding sustainable development and is centered around user needs and desires.</p> 


			<h3>Background</h3> 
			 <p>California governor Gavin Newsom has passed a proposal to ban new gas-powered cars by 2035 to fight against California emmissions. This bold decision is well-intentioned and holds prospects for similar environmental acts across the US, but convincing the people and industries of an entire state, let alone the entire country to initiate this dramatic transition from gas to electric is a difficult task.</p>


			<h3>Identifying the Problem</h3>
			<p>Our team started off by researching articles, official government documents, and online communities to gain a bettter understanding about the current discourse and public opinion surrounding electric vehicles.</p>
				
			<img id="evolve-img" src="../images/evolve/Map.png" alt="problems, constraints, and potential">
			
			<p> Through our <a id="proto-link" style="text-decoration: underline" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BpImouls4tJksdx74e58mxpmOe0mT9Lb7nmTLWcZTtE/edit">web research</a>, we were able to create a a diagram of constraints, problems, and potential solutions, and brainstorm further ideas to tackle these issues. </p> Our findings were exemplified by this statement from the 2021 EV Consumer Behavior Report by Fuels Institute, “Factors influencing likeliness of PEV purchase in 2017- 2019 are 
			Affordability, Time Saving, Charger Availability, Familiarity and Options.” 
			<p>This helped us during the brainstorming process, as we were able to organize our ideas around these influences. For example, I proposed a feature that would match potential buyers with EVs based on their lifestyle and budget, which would later become one of the primary fixtures of our app.</p><br>
			

			<img id="evolve-img" src="../images/evolve/brainstorming.png" alt="Brainstorming on Figma">
			<p class="img-des"><i>Brainstorming on Figma</i></p>

			<p class="intro-problem"> With these ideas in mind, we thought about...</p>
			
			<p class=findings id="problem-statement"><b>How might we help <span style="color: #EA7197">prospective EV Buyers become more informed on technical and financial aspects of owning an EV </span>in order to facilitate their transition from gas-powered to electric vehicles?</b> <br>

			<h3>User Research</h3>
			<ol type="I">
				<li class="subsection">Personas</li>
				<p> Based on our online research and community observations, we created primary and secondary personas to establish our stakeholders. The final versions of these personas were developed further through observations from user interviews in order to pinpoint the the needs, wants, and behavioral traits of our target users.
				<div id ="center" class="personas">  
						<img src="../images/evolve/Primary_Persona.png" alt="Primary persona">
				</div>
					<p>Based on our online research and community observations, May represents our primary user base: the <b>Middle Class Prospective Buyer, age 30-45</b>. Stastically, they are starting families and have a commutable job, and thus are on the market for a reliable family vehicle. However, they may be wary of the high price tag associated with EVs and be more comfortable with operating gas vehicles </p>
					<div id ="center" class="personas">
						<img src="../images/evolve/Secondary_Persona.png" alt="Secondary persona">
					</div>
					<p>Jay represents our secondary user base: the <b> Upper Class Prospective Buyer, age 20-35</b>. Their higher salary affords them more financial freedom to choose an EV and the new technology may be more appealing to a younger generation. However, they may not view them as a first choice due to inconvenient charging times in a fast-paced, travel-heavy lifestyle.</p> 
					<p>This demographic is also the most stastically likely to be <b>Current EV Owners</b>, another essential element of our secondary user base, with many being new buyers who might benefit from a community of individuals with similar vehicle experience.</p>

				</p>
				<li class="subsection">Storyboarding</li>
				<p>After identifying our stakeholders, we formulated storyboards that illustrated scenarios that our users might face by establishing the <b>context</b>, the <b>problem</b>, <b>our solution</b>, and the <b>resolution</b>.</p>
				<div id ="center"> 
					<div class="storyboard">
						<img src="../images/evolve/Financial_Plan.png" alt="The financial plan feature helps May learn more about the costs and savings associated with EVs">
						<div class="img-des">May is worried about the higher initial cost of EVs, so the financial plan feature helps May learn more about the costs and savings associated with EVs.</div>

						<img src="../images/evolve/Car_Match.png" alt="The Car Match feature helps the user find an EV based on their lifestyle and budget preferences and minimizes research time">
						<div class="img-des">Jay is unfamiliar and overwhelmed by the variety of EV options, so the the Car Match feature can help him find the perfect EV based on his lifestyle and budget preferences and minimizes research time.</div>

						<img src="../images/evolve/EV_Community.png" alt="Creating a community of EV owners and prospective buyers facilitates communication and the flow of information">
						<div class="img-des">May is curious to find more information about EVs, so the Community feature connects with other prospective buyers and current EV owners to help answer questions and make suggestions.</div>

						<img src="../images/evolve/Community_Challenges.png" alt="The Community Challenge feature encourages users to get involved through environment-based games and spread awareness about the sustainable transportation">
						<div class="img-des">The Community Challenge feature encourages users to get involved through environment-based games and spread awareness about the benefits of sustainable transportation.</div>
					</div>
			    </div>
				<p>Showing these storyboards during our user interviews allowed us to gain helpful feedback as to how realistic and applicable these situations and solutions were to daily life. </p>


				<li class="subsection">User Interview Insights</li>
				<p>After conducting 7 user interviews (3 primary, 4 secondary), I took responsibility for all <a href= "../images/evolve/Interview_Coding.pdf" target="_blank" style= "text-decoration: underline; color: #b20a50">interview analysis and coding</a>  and discovered 3 key insights:</p>
					<div class=findings>
					<p>
					<ol type="1" font-size: 24px; class="big-indent">
						<li class="insight" id="first">Secondary users are more likely to be less informed about EVs and could benefit from guidance during the research process</li>
						<li class="insight">Environmental impact is not a significant factor in EV consideration</li>
						<li class="insight">Primary users are more likely to dismiss EVs because of high cost than secondary users</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				</div>					
			
				<p>These findings significantly changed the trajectory of the app, as we discovered that even though we were tackling an environmental issue, <i class="bold" style="color: #b20a50"><b>approaching the user from an environmentalist standpoint was not the most effective way</b></i>.</p> 
					
				<p>Instead, we leaned into the <span class="bold" style="color: #b20a50">“economical over ecological”</span> mindset of the Prospective Buyer in order to <span class="bold" style="color: #b20a50">maximize efficiency for secondary users</span> and <span class="bold" style="color: #b20a50">increase financial transparency for primary users</span>. </p> Furthermore, we saw an expanded role and possibility of interaction for current EV owners, as those that we interviewed expressed the learning curve of operating an EV and that they often found themselves helping others at charging stations.

			</ol>
			<br>
			<span class="intro-problem">So, our solution evolved into...</span>
			<p id="solution"><span style="color:#EA7197">EVolve</span>, the one-stop-shop for sustainable transportation preparation</p>
			<p>Our goal is to help the user create a curated financial plan, get matched with a car based on their lifestyle, and connect with a community of other prospective and current EV owners so that they can be more prepared and open to transitioning to an EV. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>Prototyping</h3>

			<ol type="I">
				<li class="subsection">Wireframes</li>
				<p>With a clear goal in mind, we started by creating wireframes to map out possible features and interactions.</p>
				<a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/vvnRwJLFD5B2eAAiiEoxKt/A4--Wireframes?node-id=2%3A1349&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A1349&show-proto-sidebar=1" target="_blank"><span style="color: #b20a50; text-decoration: underline">View our interactive wireframes on Figma</span></a>
				<br><br>
				<img class="image-space" id="evolve-img" src="../images/evolve/Wireframes.png" alt="Wireframes created on Figma">

				<li class="subsection">LoFi Prototype</li>
				<p>Our wireframes gave us a clearer picture of the direction we wanted EVolve to take, and we decided that it should convey a welcoming and friendly, yet clean practical interface.</p>
				<p>We moved onto further developing the features and interactions with more complexity, and were also able to integrate color and theming to create a more polished, cohesive look. </p>
				<p><a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/iLkmvHk1CGib3uxIWqfM4f/A4-Copy?node-id=103%3A18770&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=102%3A3949&starting-point-node-id=103%3A13329&show-proto-sidebar=1" target="_blank"><span style="color: #b20a50; text-decoration: underline">View our interactive Lo-fi Prototype on Figma</span></a></p>
				<br>

				<img class="image-space" id="evolve-img" src="../images/evolve/Lo-fi.png" alt="Lo-fi Prototype screens created on Figma">
				<br><br> 
				<li class="subsection">User Testing</li>
				<p>We solicited other students and returned to our interviewees from the User Research stage to conduct short-task interviews in order to test our prototype. Many testers were able to complete the tasks with ease and remarked on the straightforward layout and interactions, but we stumbled on a few common errors caused by:
				
					<div class="error-list" id="center">

						<div class="col"><p class="hvr-buzz" id="error"> Unclear Icons/Signifiers</div>
						<div class="col"><p class="hvr-buzz" id="error">Low<br> Readability</div>
						<div class="col"><p class="hvr-buzz" id="error">Lack of Clear Hierarchy
						</div>
					</div>

			<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p>Though EVolve was created for a course project, designing the app felt more like a labor of love. I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about the EV industry and community, and growing with the app through multiple iterations. </p>
			<p>This project also taught me the importance of teamwork and communication. The difficulties in coordination, task delegation, and underlying frustrations we faced during our User Research stage led us to do some troubleshooting and discuss our dynamic as a team, which ultimately led to a much smoother and actively collaborative experience during the Prototyping stage.</p>
	
		<h3>What's Next?</h3>
			<p>I would ultimately like conduct <span class="bold" style="color: #b20a50">usability testing</span>  using our hi-fi prototype on more 'Potential Buyer' and 'Current Owner' users, as the vehicle market is constantly changing and the app should reflect the most up-to-date needs and wants of our target audience.</p>

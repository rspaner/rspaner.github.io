			<h1>Artist Statement Poster Set</h1>

			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p> This poster set was created for UCSD's Design Communication course, which focused on teaching various typographic methods and process-focused image-making techniques through hands-on practice, culminating in a set of posters that visually reflects my artistic influences and demonstrates a grasp of fundamental graphic design principles. 
			</p>

			<h3>Denotative Poster</h3>
			<div class="poster ">
				<img src="../images/Denotative_Poster.png" alt="denotative poster image">
			</div>
			<p>This denotative typography poster demonstrates the ability to communicate information with clarity, structure and detail without evoking meaning or tone. I utilized a simple 4-column grid to maintain a clean and consistent layout and chose the san serif fonts “Museo Sans” and “Gotham” for the body text to clearly display the text without conveying any connotation about its contents. The deliberate use of font weight and size delineates the typgraphical hierachy, with an overall flow from top to bottom and flow of the body coy from left to right. The introduction and conclusion are expectedly placed at the top and bottom, respectively, to maintain the original order in the Artist Statement, but are emphasized in order provide the reader with ease of acccess to the main ideas and themes of the text.</p>

			<h3>Connotative Poster</h3>
			<div class="poster">
				<img src="../images/Connotative_Poster_Final.png" alt="connotative poster image">
			</div>
			<p>Created using Adobe InDesign, the inspiration for the layout of this poster was from derived antique Victorian scrapbooks, The decorative, commemorative, and handmade nature of these scrapbooks and the manner in which they can transport the reader to a distant past heavily ties to the themes of personal memories and comforting nostalgia discussed in my Artist Statement. The cut-and-paste arrangement is meant to evoke a sense of playful discovery, as if the viewer were leafing through a stack of of old photo albums, sharing experiences through sentimental words and pictures while exploring in the depths of their attic.  </p>

			<p>The title and introduction take the forefront in the form of a newspaper article, while the surrounding body paragraphs are designed to emulate magazine cutouts and handwritten letters. The decorative stamp effect used to express the central themes was created by layering multiple copies of letters. Though the poster is a visual departure from the denotative typography poster, the eclectic variety of fonts and sizing for each paragraph reflects how seemingly unrelated influences, such as Animal Crossing and Rococo architecture, are intertwined to create a complex depiction of creativity. The deliberate lack of hierarchy encourages the viewer to indulge in childlike curiosity and explore each element of the poster separately, unrestricted by expectations and guidelines. </p>

			<h3>Exhibition Poster</h3>
			<div class="poster">
				<img src="../images/VIS41_Final_Poster.png" alt="exhibition poster image">
			</div>
			<p>The final Exhibition Poster serves as a visual expression of my artistic influences and the principles learned through previous typography and image-making exercises. Most notably, the title of the exhibition changed to “Rediscovering Imagination”, as I felt it more acutely encapsulated the innocence and wonder of childhood and its juxtaposition to the stringent realities of adulthood. As this subject has strong ties to storytelling, I was inspired by the visuals in science fiction and fantasy novels. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The background image was initially created using Photoshop, in which I repeatedly applied a warp effect to a photo taken of ribbons stuffed in the head of a desk lamp. I then adjusted the colors to create panels that represented the four elements, a nod to the thematic prevalence of nature in Impressionism, one of the influences described in my Artist Statement. Utilizing the flowing ribbon’s resemblance to hair, I painted over the image in Procreate, referencing Victorian portraits to establish a dreamy, regal tone, reminscent of a fairytale character. The typeface, “All Round Gothic”, was selected due to its minimalistic and contempary shape, which serves to combine the sleek modernity of the future with the vibrant, romantic image of the past.</p>

			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>Circle K International is the largest service organization in the world, with the UCSD chapter being one of nearly 550 chapters worldwide. The Tech Team is comprised of the UI Design Team, which is responsible for designing the CKI website, and Programming Team, which is responsible for implementing and maintaining the website. </p>

			<h3>Identifying the Problems</h3>
			<p>Prior to joining the Tech Team, we were tasked with learning about Circle K through the current website on desktop and mobile, allowing us to take an objective look at the website and demonstrate how effectively it presents information to users who have no prior knowledge about the organization. </p>
			
			<!-- <p>Through this prelimary observations and more in-depth examination, we identified several issues with the Homepage and About Page. </p> -->

			
			<img class="cki-gif" src="../images/cki/homepage_old.gif" alt="The original desktop homepage">

			<p> On the homepage, the minimal use of varied color and font size in text and the uniformity of the layout creates uneffective visual hierarchy</p>
			<img class="cki-gif" src="../images/cki/old_about.gif" alt="The original desktop About page">

			<p> On the About page(s), the lack of images, lack of visual hierarchy, and large text blocks deter users from reading the overwhelming amount of information</p>

			<img class="mobile-old" src="../images/cki/original_mobile.png" alt="The original mobile homepage">
			
			
			<span class="intro-problem">With these critiques in mind, we wanted to figure out...</span>

			<p class="findings" id="problem-statement"> How might we redesign the Circle K website in order to create a more organized and visually appealing layout in order to effectively present information and garner increased interest from prospective Circle K members? </p>

			<p>So, we began sketching the to determine the layout, focusing on informational hierarchy.

			Our task was especially important because the styling used in the homepage would translate to the rest of the website, and would provide the first impression of the organization to new users.

			<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p>This project was my first design experience in which I needed to listen to the wants and needs of a client organization in order to create a product that truly represented their message. This was also my formal introduction to designing with Figma, which is one of the most valuable additions to my program skillset as an aspiring UI Designer. In the future, when our redesign is implemented by the Programming sector of the Tech Team for the 2022-2023 school year, I would like to maintain the website by soliciting user feedback from club members and interested students.</p>

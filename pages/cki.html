			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>Circle K International is the largest service organization in the world, with the UCSD chapter being one of nearly 550 chapters worldwide. The Tech Team is comprised of the UI Design Team, which is responsible for designing the CKI website, and Programming Team, which is responsible for implementing and maintaining the website. </p>

			<h3>Identifying the Problems</h3>
			<p>Prior to joining the Tech Team, we were tasked with learning about Circle K through the current website on desktop and mobile, allowing us to take an objective look at the website and demonstrate how effectively it presents information to users who have no prior knowledge about the organization. </p>
			
			<p>Through this prelimary observations and more in-depth examination, we identified several issues with the Homepage and About Page. </p>

			Homepage

			<p>long lines of text make the interface look cluttered

			<p>long length of announcements increase the need for user to scroll</p>

			<p>In both the mobile and desktop websites, the lack of images and large text blocks create minimal visual interest and deter users from reading the information</p>

			<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
			<p> How might we redesign the Circle K website in order to create a a more organize and visually appealing layout in order to effectively present information and garner increased interest from prospective Circle K members? </p>

			So, we began sketching the to determine the layout, focusing on text hierarchy

			Our task was especially important because the styling used in the homepage would translate to the rest of the website, and would provide the first impression of the organization to new users.

			<h3>Final Product</h3>
			

			<h3>Reflection</h3>
			<p>This project was my first design experience in which I needed to listen to the wants and needs of a client organization in order to create a product that truly represented their message. This was also my introduction to designing with Figma, which was the most valuable addition to my skillset as an aspiring UI Designer. In the future, when our redesign is implemented by the Programming sector of the Tech Team, I would like to maintain the design by implementing user feedback from club members and interested students.</p>
